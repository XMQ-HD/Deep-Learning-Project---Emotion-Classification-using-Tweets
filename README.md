# Deep Learning Project---Emotion Classification using Tweets
## Project Title: Emotion Classification using Tweets
## Area of Research: Natural Language Processing.
## Problem Statement:   

Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiencesknowledge, and beliefs, Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveved through text, a robust mechanism capable ofcapturing and modeling diferent linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. Hence, the task of this project is todevelop deep learning based solutions that can accurately identify emotion presented in textual data.  

## Dataset:

|Emotions | Amount | Hashtags|
|sadness | 214,454 | #depressed, #grief|
|joy | 167,027 | #fun, #joy|
|fear | 102,460 | #fear,#worried|
|anger | 102,289 | #mad, #pissed|
|surprise | 46,101 | #strange,#surprise|
|trust | 19,222 | #hope,#secure|
|disgust | 8.934 | #awful,#eww|
|anticipation | 3,975 | #pumped, #ready|
